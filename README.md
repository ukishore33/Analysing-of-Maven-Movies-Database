The aim of the project was to extract relevant data from the dataset representing a movies Database.

The Maven Movies Dataset was transferred to MySQL using the Import Wizard.

Concepts like Aggregate functions, Group By, Temporary Tables, Views, and Stored Procedures were used to fetch required results.

The dataset was used to extract information of users such as it returns first 10 actors name length along with their name, List all Oscar awardees(Actors who received Oscar award) with their full names and length of their names, Return the actors who have acted in the film ‘Frost Head’, Pull all the films acted by the actor ‘Will Wilson’, Pull all the films which were rented and return in the month of May, Pull all the films with ‘Comedy’ category.
